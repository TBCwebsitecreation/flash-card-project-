## Trivia Self Scoring Project 1

## Project Description

I am a huge fan of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and Marvel, Legends, Harry Potter, Twilight, Lion King, and Star Wars movies. I would like to call it Family Nite Trivia for this game will be fun for kids and adults. The player is given a choice but they will not know what they have chosen until they click on one of the six boxes. The player after clicking and after confirmation is taken to the next screen where the game is set.

A set of 10 questions are asked and after that, the user can either collect their final score or go back to the main page to choose another set of questions. The scores will keep on adding up until the user does not terminate this game.

## My Take on this project

Creating this project for the first time was hard. I spent one day living in the fear that I will not be able to do it. I went back to revisit some of the topcis and covered many videos regarding each topic. I later realized it was pure fear. I should have jumped into the project. Note to self: don't wait for enlightment. I plan to finish this project.
